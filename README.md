## Instructions
First, you need to have [Python installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/) *version 3.7.2.* 

You can download the repository by clicking "Clone or Download" button on the top right. The file includes:

* *Events_test.txt* includes all the existing events in your calendar. For example, meetings, classes.

* *Tasks_Training.csv* file includes the historical data of your previous tasks. Don't worry about the start time and end time in the file when you create your own one.

* *Tasks_test.xlsx* file includes the tasks you want to do. **Note** that you need to modify the due dates to be the dates of next week.

* *scheduler.py* is the program you will actually run. 
* *DiamondHacks_ProductiveScheduler.pptx* includes some inspiration and application of the project.

Open the terminal on Mac or command prompt in Windows and go to the folder where you put the downloaded files.
```terminal
cd directory_path
```
To start the program, you enter: (**Note** if you have python2, use python instead of python3)
```terminal
python3 scheduler.py
```
